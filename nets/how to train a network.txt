YOU NEED:
- the LMDBs for your training/testing sets as well as the mean over all images mean.prototxt(just run prepareData.py, specifying your data)
- a netDescription.prototxt (you must specify the path to the train&test LMDBs and the train&test mean.prototxt files here in the first layer)
- a solver.prototxt (you must specify the path to the netDescription.prototxt here)

Then run the following line in the terminal (from pachaiConfigs).

$ /full/path/to/caffe/build/tools/caffe train --solver /full/path/to/my_solver.prototxt
